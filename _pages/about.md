# About me 
Hi! I am a first year CS PhD student at ***Text Mining Lab, Stevens Institute of Technology*** where I am fortunate enough to be advised by ***[Prof.Xueqing Liu](https://liususan091219.github.io/)***. 

My research interests lie broadly in ***Vulnerability Detection***, ***Agentic Coding*** and ***LLM-based Agent*** – check my ***[Publications](../_pages/publications.md)*** or ***[CV](../Yingming_CV.pdf)*** for more information. I am open to other topics, so feel free to reach out if you’d like to chat!

Outside of research, I enjoy the physical and mental pleasure of working out and playing basketball.
