# About me 
Hi! I am a senior student at ***Artificial Intelligence Management lab (AIM), CNU*** where I am fortunate enough to be advised by ***[Prof.Leilei Lin](https://dblp.org/pid/159/6831.html)***.

My research interests lie broadly in ***Graph Convolutional Networks*** and ***Large Language Models***, especially LLM-based Agent – check my ***[Publications](../_pages/publications.md)*** or ***[CV](../Yingming_CV.pdf)*** for more information. I am open to other topics, so feel free to reach out if you’d like to chat!

Outside of research, I enjoy the physical and mental pleasure of working out and playing basketball.
